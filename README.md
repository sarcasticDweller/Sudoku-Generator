Generates a Sudoku answer key and puzzle. Heavy work in progress.

Crazy thing, there's [6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_Sudoku) possible valid Sudoku boards, and somehow, generating one is still quite a difficult project! Completion of this project will require improving my understanding of mathematics and algorithms. I fully intend to create a finished product, but it will take quite some time.
